# Learn X in Y minutes

Whirlwind tours of (several, hopefully many someday) popular and
ought-to-be-more-popular programming languages, presented as valid,
commented code and explained as they go.

## We need YOU!...

... to write more inline code tutorials. Just grab an existing file from
this repo and copy the formatting (don't worry, it's all very simple).
Make a new file, send a pull request, and if it passes muster I'll get it up pronto.
Remember to fill in the author and author\_url fields so you get credited
properly!
