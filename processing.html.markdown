Processing is a programming language for creation of digital arts and multimedia content, allowing non-programmers to
learn fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context.  
While the language is based off on Java language,
its syntax has been largely influenced by both Java and Javascript syntaxes. [See more here](https://processing.org/reference/)  
The language also comes with its official IDE to compile and run the scripts.

```Processing
// Single-line comment starts with //

/*
    Since Processing is based on Java,
    the syntax for its comments are the same as Java (as you may have noticed above)!
    Multi-line comments are wrapped around /* */
*/

// In Processing, your program's entry point is a function named setup() with a void return type.
// Note! The syntax looks strikingly similar to that of C++
void setup() {
  // This prints out the classic output "Hello World!" to the console when run.
  println("Hello World!"); // Another language with a semi-column trap, aint it?
}

```
