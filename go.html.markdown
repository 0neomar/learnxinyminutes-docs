Go was created out of the need to get work done.  It's not the latest trend
in computer science, but it is the newest fastest way to solve real-world
problems.

It has familiar concepts of imperative languages with static typing.
It's fast to compile and fast to execute, it adds easy-to-understand
concurrency to leverage today's multi-core CPUs, and has features to
help with large-scale programming.

Go comes with a great standard library and an enthusiastic community.

```Go

/* Multi-

// A package clause starts every source file.
// Main is a special name declaring an executable rather than a library.
package main

// An import declaration comes next.  It declares library packages referenced
// in this file.  The list must be exactly correct!  Missing or unused packages
// are errors, not warnings.
import (
	"fmt"      // A package in the Go standard library
	"net/http" // Yes, a web server!
	"strconv"  // String conversions
)

// A function definition.  Main is special.  It is the entry point for the
// executable program.  Love it or hate it, Go uses brace brackets.
func main() {
	// Println is a function that outputs a line to stdout.  It can be
	// called here because fmt has been imported and the function name
	// "Println" is upper case.  Symbols starting with an upper case letter
	// are publicly visible.  No other special syntax is needed to export
	// something from a package.
	// To call Println, qualify it with the package name, fmt.
	fmt.Println("Hello world!")

	// Call another function within this package.
	beyondHello()
}

// Idiomatic Go uses camel case.  Functions have parameters in parentheses.
// If there are no parameters, empty parens are still required.
func beyondHello() {
	var x int // Variable declaration.  Variables must be declared before use.
	x = 3     // Variable assignment.
	// "Short" declarations use := syntax to declare and assign, infering the

	// no p++ to get at the next one.

	// as needed.  Here memory for r will be still be referenced after the
	// function returns so it will be allocated as well.  The int allocated
	// with new on the other hand will no longer be referenced and can be
	// garbage collected as needed by the Go runtime.  The memory allocated
	// with make will still be referenced at that one element, and so it
	// cannot be garbage collected.  All 20 ints remain in memory because

	learnInterfaces() // Good stuff coming up!
}

// An interface is a list of functionality that a type supports.  Notably
// missing from an interface definition is any declaration of which types
// implement the interface.  Types simply implement an interface or they don't.
//
// An interface can have any number of methods, but it's actually common
// for an interface to have only single method.  It is idiomatic in this
// case for the single method to be named with some action, and for the
// interface name to end in "er."
//
// An interface definition is one kind of a type definition.  Interface is
// a built in type.  Stringer is defined here as an interface type with one
// method, String.
type Stringer interface {
	String() string
}

// Struct is another built in type.  A struct aggregates "fields."
// Pair here has two fields, ints named x and y.
type pair struct {
	x, y int
}

// User defined types can have "methods." These are functions that operate
// in the context of an instance of the user defined type.  The instance
// is called the "receiver" and is identified with a declaration just in front
// of the method name.  The receiver here is "p." In most ways the receiver
// works just like a function parameter.
//
// This String method has the same name and return value as the String method
// of the Stringer interface.  Further, String is the only method of Stringer.
// The pair type thus implements all methods of the Stringer interface and
// we say simply that pair implements Stringer.  No other syntax is needed.
func (p pair) String() string {
	// Sprintf is another public function in package fmt.
	// Dot syntax references fields of p.
	return fmt.Sprintf("(%d, %d)", p.x, p.y)
}

func learnInterfaces() {
	// Brace syntax is a "struct literal."  It evaluates to an initialized
	// struct.  The := syntax declares and initializes p to this struct.
	p := pair{3, 4}
	fmt.Println(p.String()) // call String method of p, of type pair.
	var i Stringer          // declare i of type Stringer.
	i = p                   // valid because pair implements Stringer
	// Call String method of i, of type Stringer.  Output same as above.
	fmt.Println(i.String())
	// It gets more interesting now.  We defined Stringer in this file,
	// but the same interface happens to be defined in package fmt.
	// Pair thus implements fmt.Stringer as well, and does so with no
	// declaration of the fact.  The definition of pair doesn't mention
	// any interfaces at all, and of course the authors of fmt.Stringer
	// had no idea that we were going to define pair.
	//
	// Functions in the fmt package know how to print some standard built in
	// types, and beyond that, they see if a type implements fmt.Stringer.
	// If so, they simply call the String method to ask an object for a
	// printable representation of itself.
	fmt.Println(p) // output same as above. Println calls String method.
	fmt.Println(i) // output same as above

	learnErrorHandling()
}

func learnErrorHandling() {
	// Sometimes you just need to know if something worked or not.  Go has
	// a ", ok" idiom for that.  Something, a map expression here, but commonly
	// a function, can return a boolean value of ok or not ok as a second
	// return value.
	m := map[int]string{3: "three", 4: "four"}
	if x, ok := m[1]; !ok { // , ok is optional but see how useful it is.
		fmt.Println("no one there")
	} else {
		fmt.Print(x)
	}
	// An error value communicates not just "ok" but more about the problem.
	if _, err := strconv.Atoi("non-int"); err != nil { // _ discards value
		// prints "strconv.ParseInt: parsing "non-int": invalid syntax"
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
	// error is a built in type.  It is an interface with a single method,
	// defined internally as,
	//
	// type error interface {
	//     Error() string
	// }
	//
	// The string returned by the Error method is conventionally a printable
	// error message.  You can define your own error types by simply adding
	// an Error method.  Your type then automatically implements the error
	// interface.  We've seen two interfaces now, fmt.Stringer and error.

	// We'll revisit interfaces a little later.  Meanwhile,
	learnConcurrency()
}

// Go has concurrency support in the language definition.  The element of
// concurrent execution is called a "goroutine" and is similar to a thread
// but "lighter."  Goroutines are multiplexed to operating system threads
// and a running Go program can have far more goroutines than available OS
// threads.  If a machine has multiple CPU cores, goroutines can run in
// parallel.
//
// Go "Channels" allow communication between goroutines in a way that is
// both powerful and easy to understand.  Channel is a type in Go and objects
// of type channel are first class objects--they can be assigned to variables,
// passed around to functions, and so on.  A channel works conceptually much
// like a Unix pipe.  You put data in at one end and it comes out the other.
// Channel "send" and "receive" operations are goroutine-safe.  No locks
// or additional synchronization is needed.

// Inc increments a number, and sends the result on a channel.  The channel
// operation makes this function useful to run concurrently with other
// goroutines.  There is no special declaration though that says this function
// is concurrent.  It is an ordinary function that happens to have a
// parameter of channel type.
func inc(i int, c chan int) {
	c <- i + 1 // <- is the "send" operator when a channel appears on the left.
}

// We'll use inc to increment some numbers concurrently.
func learnConcurrency() {
	// Same make function used earlier to make a slice.  Make allocates and
	// initializes slices, maps, and channels.
	c := make(chan int)
	// Start three concurrent goroutines.  Numbers will be incremented
	// concurrently, perhaps in parallel if the machine is capable and
	// properly configured.  All three send to the same channel.
	go inc(0, c) // go is a statement that starts a new goroutine.
	go inc(10, c)
	go inc(-805, c)
	// Read three results from the channel and print them out.
	// There is no telling in what order the results will arrive!
	fmt.Println(<-c, <-c, <-c) // channel on right, <- is "receive" operator.

	cs := make(chan string)       // another channel, this one handles strings.
	cc := make(chan chan string)  // a channel of channels.
	go func() { c <- 84 }()       // start a new goroutine just to send a value
	go func() { cs <- "wordy" }() // again, for cs this time
	// Select has syntax like a switch statement but is doing something
	// pretty different.  Each case involves a channel operation.  In rough
	// terms, a case is selected at random out of the cases that are ready to
	// communicate.  If none are ready, select waits for one to become ready.
	select {
	case i := <-c: // the value received can be assigned to a variable
		fmt.Println("it's a", i)
	case <-cs: // or the value received can be discarded
		fmt.Println("it's a string")
	case <-cc: // empty channel, not ready for communication.
		fmt.Println("didn't happen.")
	}
	// At this point a value was taken from either c or cs.  One of the two
	// goroutines started above has completed, the other will remain blocked.

	learnWebProgramming() // Go does it.  You want to do it too.
}

// A simple web server can be created with a single function from the standard
// library.  ListenAndServe, in package net/http, listens at the specified
// TCP address and uses an object that knows how to serve data.  "Knows how"
// means "satisfies an interface."  The second parameter is of type interface,
// specifically http.Handler.  http.Handler has a single method, ServeHTTP.
func learnWebProgramming() {
	err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", pair{})
	// Error returns are ubiquitous in Go.  Always check error returns and
	// do something with them.  Often it's enough to print it out as an
	// indication of what failed.  Of course there are better things to do
	// in production code: log it, try something else, shut everything down,
	// and so on.
	fmt.Println(err)
}

// You can make any type into an http.Hander by implementing ServeHTTP.
// Lets use the pair type we defined earlier, just because we have it
// sitting around.  ServeHTTP has two parameters.  The request parameter
// is a struct that we'll ignore here.  http.ResponseWriter is yet another
// interface!  Here it is an object supplied to us with the guarantee that
// it implements its interface, which includes a method Write.
// We call this Write method to serve data.
func (p pair) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	w.Write([]byte("You learned Go in Y minutes!"))
}

// And that's it for a proof-of-concept web server!  If you run this program
// it will print out all the lines from the earlier parts of the lesson, then
// start this web server.  To hit the web server, just point a browser at
// localhost:8080 and you'll see the message.  (Then you can probably press
// ctrl-C to kill it.)
```

## Further Reading

The root of all things Go is the [official Go web site](http://golang.org/).
There you can follow the tutorial, play interactively, and read lots.

The language definition itself is highly recommended.  It's easy to read
and amazingly short (as language definitions go these days.)
