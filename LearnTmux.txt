  tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be
created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached
from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

  This will be a quick walkthough detailing the basic method of controlling tmux
for users to get acclimated quickly. Once you feel comfortable manipulating
tmux to suit your needs, I strongly suggest you read the man pages.



```
# Session Management
    
    tmux new         Create new session
    -s "Session"     Create named session
    -n "Window"      Create named Window
    -c "/dir"        Start in target directory
    ex: $ tmux new -c "~/" -s "Name" -n "Name"
    
    C^b $            Rename current session
    
    C^b d            Detach current session
    C^b D            Select session to detach
    
    tmux attach      Attach last/available session
    -t "#"           Attach target session
    -d               Detach the session from other instances
    tmux ls          List open sessions

    C^b c            Create another window
    C^b "            Split Horizontally
    C^b %            Split Vertically

    C^b q            Briefly display pane indexes
    C^#              Choose current window by #

    C^b {            Swap current/previous pane 
    C^b }            Swap current/next pane
